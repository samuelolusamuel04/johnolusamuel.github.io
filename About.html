<h1>About</h1>

<p>This project is designed as a social media website and it basically helps you to connect to your loved ones, watch both life and recorded videos, view posts, post for others to see and lots more...</p>

<p>This project is dedicated to God Almighty for the wisdom knowledge and understanding he gave me in the course of designing this website. I also dedicate this project to my parents, siblings, teachers, and peers for their support towards the success of this project</p>
